Description: Implements linear, logistic, and cox regression on vertically
    partitioned data across several data partners.  Data is not shared
    between data partners or the analysis center and the computations can
    be considered secure.  For each regression, there are three different 
    methods of sharing data. 2Party: two data partners which communicate 
    directly without an intermediate analysis center; 3Party: two data 
    partners which do not communicate expect via an analysis center,
    and KParty: two or more data partners plus an analysis center which 
    are all allowed to communicate.  2Party and 3Party use a form of 
    secure multiplication as found in Karr, et. al, 2007 and Slavkovic
    et. al. 200x.  Kparty uses.... as found in ....  Full details can 
    be found in Samizo 2019.
