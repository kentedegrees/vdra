Description: Implements linear, logistic, and Cox regression on vertically
    partitioned data across several data partners.  Data is not shared
    between data partners or the analysis center and the computations can
    be considered secure.  Three different protocols are implemented. 
	  2-Party: two data partners which communicate directly without an 
	  intermediate analysis center; 2T-Party: two data partners communicate 
	  indirectly via an analysis center, and KT-Party: two or more 
	  data partners plus an analysis center are all allowed to 
	  communicate directly.  2-Party and 2^T-Party use a form of secure 
	  multiplication as found in Karr, et. al. (2009) "Privacy-Preserving Analysis
    of Vertically Partitioned Data Using Secure Matrix Products"
    and Slavkovic et. al. (2007) "Secure Logistic Regression of Horizontally 
    and Vertically Partitioned Distributed Databases" <doi:10.1109/ICDMW.2007.114>.  
    Full details can be found in Samizo (In preparation).
